Legend:  
The trainers of December Course 2024 are arranging participants into $N$ groups, numbered $1$ to $N$, placed in a row. For simplicity, each participant in group $i$ initially wears a shirt of color $i$.  

The trainers can issue commands to modify group shirt colors or check specific color statistics. They provide $Q$ commands in total, which must be processed in the given order. Commands are of the following two types:  

1. $1\ x\ c$: Change the shirt color of all participants in the group $x$ and all connected groups (groups reachable by moving through adjacent groups with the same shirt color) to color $c$.  

2. $2\ c$: Report how many groups currently have participants wearing shirts of color $c$.  

Input format:  
The input is given in the following format:  

$N\ Q$  

$query1$  

$query2$  

$\vdots$  

$queryQ$  

Each query is in one of the following formats:  
$1\ x\ c$  
$2\ c$  

Output format:  
Let $q$ be the number of type $2$ queries. Print $q$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains the answer to the $i$-th type $2$ query.  

Scoring:
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
            \hline
            \textbf{Subtask} & \textbf{Score} & \textbf{Additional constraints} \\
            \hline
            1 & 30 & All queries are of type $2$ \\
            \hline
            2 & 30 & $N \leq 10^4$, $Q \leq 10^4$ \\
            \hline
            3 & 40 & $N \leq 5 \times 10^5$, $Q \leq 10^5$ \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}


Notes:  
1. After the first query, group $5$ is repainted to color $4$.  
2. After the second query, groups $4$ and $5$ are repainted to color $2$.  
3. The third query asks for the number of groups with color $2$, which is $3$ (groups $4$, $5$, and initially $2$).  
4. The fourth query repaints group $3$ to color $2$.  
5. The fifth query repaints groups $1$ and $2$ to color $3$.  
6. The sixth query asks for the number of groups with color $3$, which is $4$ (groups $1$, $2$, $3$, and initially $3$).
